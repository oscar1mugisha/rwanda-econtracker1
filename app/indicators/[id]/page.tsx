      "An 8.2% growth rate means Rwanda's economy is performing very well. This suggests more jobs are being created, businesses are expanding, and living standards are improving. It's one of the highest growth rates in Africa, showing Rwanda's strong economic momentum.",

      "Inflation measures how much more expensive things become over time. It tracks the average price increase for a basket of goods and services that typical families buy.",
    whatItMeans:
      "A 7.1% inflation rate means prices are rising faster than ideal. This makes life more expensive for families, especially for food and transport. The government and central bank are working to bring this down to around 5% through various policies.",

    definition:
      "The Monetary Policy Rate is the interest rate set by Rwanda's central bank. It influences how much banks charge for loans and pay for savings.",
    whatItMeans:
      "At 6.5%, the central bank is maintaining a balanced approach. This rate affects how expensive it is to borrow money for homes, businesses, or education. A stable rate suggests the bank is comfortable with current economic conditions.",

    definition:
      "The exchange rate shows how many Rwandan Francs you need to buy one US Dollar. It reflects the relative strength of Rwanda's currency.",
    whatItMeans:
      "At 1,285 RWF per USD, the Franc has strengthened slightly (fewer Francs needed per Dollar). This makes imports cheaper but exports more expensive. A stable exchange rate helps businesses plan and keeps import prices predictable.",

    whatItMeans:
